This is a repository for the latex code containing my undergraduate senior thesis, "Efficient Parallelism Detection for Heterogeneous Computing". My advisor was Professor Kelly Shaw at Reed College.

The compiled pdf of the document is in [thesis.pdf](https://github.com/weepingwillowben/thesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf).

The main code contribution, the parallelism detection tool itself, is in my git repository [SD3-implementation](https://github.com/weepingwillowben/SD3-implementation).

Supporting code is unfortunately based on LoopProf, which has not been released publicly, so it is not publicly available. Please contact me at benblack769@gmail.com or Kelly Shaw at kshaw@reed.edu for full code and data.
